# Database Configuration
# For local development with PostgreSQL Docker container:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://marvelcdc:marvelcdc123@localhost:5432/marvelcdc_dev?schema=public"
# For production, use PostgreSQL URL provided by Railway

# Authentication
# Generate a secure random string (64+ characters recommended)
# Example: openssl rand -base64 64
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secure-jwt-secret-change-in-production-64-characters-minimum"

# Email Configuration (Brevo - supports both SMTP and HTTP API)
# Choose email delivery method: "smtp" or "http" (default: "http" for better reliability)
EMAIL_METHOD="http"

# === HTTP API Method (Recommended) ===
# Get your API key from https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api
BREVO_API_KEY="your-brevo-api-key-here"

# === SMTP Method (Alternative) ===
# If you prefer SMTP or HTTP API fails, uncomment these:
# BREVO_SMTP_KEY="your-brevo-smtp-key-here"
# BREVO_LOGIN_EMAIL="your-brevo-account-email@gmail.com"
# SMTP_PORT="587"  # Use 2525 if 587 is blocked by your hosting provider

# === Common Settings ===
# Set to a verified sender address in your Brevo account
FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
# Your application's base URL
BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Application Environment
NODE_ENV="development"

# Server Configuration (for deployment)
NUXT_HOST="0.0.0.0"
NUXT_PORT="3000"

# External API Configuration
# MarvelCDB API base URL (should not need to change)
MARVELCDB_API_URL="https://marvelcdb.com/api/public"

# Email Settings Notes:
# 1. Sign up for a free Brevo account at https://www.brevo.com/
# 2. Verify your FROM_EMAIL address in Brevo dashboard
# 3. For HTTP API: Create an API key in Settings > API Keys
# 4. For SMTP: Create an SMTP key in Settings > SMTP & API
# 5. Free tier includes 300 emails/day
# 6. In production, set BASE_URL to your domain (e.g., https://marvelcdc.railway.app)
# 7. HTTP API is recommended as it avoids SMTP port blocking issues in cloud environments
