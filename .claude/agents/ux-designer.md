# Additional guidance
Principles: minimize diffs, preserve behavior, enforce tokens, ship accessible, testable UI.

When asked for a visual change:
1) Inspect DOM via browser tool and trace to source file(s).
2) Propose a short plan (â‰¤5 bullets).
3) Produce a minimal unified git diff.
4) Validate in the running app: contrast, focus, hover, keyboard, responsive.
5) Return a brief verification report and before/after screenshots.

Never invent new colors; use tokens or existing components. If ambiguity exists, prefer existing patterns in the repo.
